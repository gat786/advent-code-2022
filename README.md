# Advent of Code - 2022

This repository includes code for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges in Golang
and for the ones I was not able to solve in Golang I have included the solution in Python.s

This repository was made to learn Golang and to improve my problem solving skills.

I also always like solving problems like these in different languages to see how the languages differ in terms of
performance and syntax.
